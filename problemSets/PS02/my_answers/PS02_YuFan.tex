	\section*{Question 1: Political Science}
	\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

\begin{table}[h!]

	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\

		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\

\end{table}
 	\vspace{1cm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=4, lastline=29]{my_answer_YuFan.R}
	chi-squared=3.791168\\
\end{enumerate}
	
 	\vspace{5cm}	
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = 0.1$?\\
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=31, lastline=36]{my_answer_YuFan.R}
	P-value is 0.1502306, greater than 0.1. So we can't reject the Null. There is no significant association between a driver's social class and the police officer's behavior.\\
\end{enumerate}

 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item [(c)]
    Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below. \\

 		\\
 		Lower class  &-0.3220306  &1.641957   &-1.523026 \\
 		
 	\end{tabular}
 \end{table}
 \end{enumerate}
 
 	\vspace{5cm}
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item [(d)]
    How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?\\
    
    Upper class: Not Stopped: The observed frequencies are slightly higher than the expected frequencies, but the difference is not significant (absolute value less than 1).
    
    Upper class: Bribe requested: the number of observations is lower than the expected number of frequencies and the difference is close to significant (absolute value between 1 and 2).
    
    Upper class: Stopped/given warning: The observed frequency is higher than the expected frequency and the difference is close to significant (absolute value between 1 and 2).
    
    Lower class: Not Stopped: The observed frequency is lower than the expected frequency, but the difference is not significant.
    
    Lower class: Bribe requested: The observed frequency is higher than the expected frequency and the difference is nearly significant.
    
    Lower class: Stopped/given warning: the observed frequency is lower than the expected frequency and the difference is also close to significant.
    
    Significant differences: upper class drivers were more likely to be given stops/warnings, while lower class drivers were more likely to be asked for bribes. These differences are significant, suggesting that social class may influence police behaviour.
    
    Non-significant difference: the difference between the observed and expected frequencies of non-stopping behaviour across the two classes is not significant.
    These results suggest that there are significant differences in police behaviour towards drivers from different social classes, which may reflect inequalities in social structure and law enforcement practices.\\
 
 \end{enumerate}

 \section*{Question 2: Economics}
 Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\
 
 \noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

 \newpage
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. 
 	
 	Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities between villages with reserved and unreserved council heads.\\
 	
 	Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant difference  iin the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities between villages with reserved and unreserved council heads.\\
 	
 	
 	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).

 	\vspace{5cm}

 	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
 	
 	The coefficient estimate for the reservation policy is 9.252, indicating a positive correlation between the reservation policy and the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in villages.  Villages that adopted the reservation policy had 9.252 more drinking water facilities compared to those that did not implement the policy.\\
