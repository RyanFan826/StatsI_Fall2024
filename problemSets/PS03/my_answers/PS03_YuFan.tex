\section*{Question 1}

		The model equation is \( \text{voteshare} = 0.579 + 0.0417 \times \text{difflog} \). The intercept is 0.579, indicating that when difflog is 0, the predicted voteshare is 0.579. The coefficient for difflog is 0.0417, meaning that for every 1-unit increase in difflog, voteshare increases by 0.0417 on average, and this effect is highly significant (p-value < 0.001).\\
		
		The t-value for difflog is 43.04, and the p-value is much smaller than 0.001, indicating a significant positive impact of difflog on voteshare. The F-statistic is 1853, showing the overall significance of the model.\\
		
		The model’s goodness of fit, represented by the R-squared \( R^2 \), is 0.3673, suggesting that difflog explains about 36.73% of the variation in `voteshare`.\\
		
		In conclusion, the difference in logs (difflog) has a significant positive effect on the incumbent's vote share (voteshare). Each unit increase in difflog results in a 0.0417-unit increase in voteshare, with this result being statistically highly significant.\\

			The t-value for difflog is 17.54, and the p-value is much smaller than 0.001, indicating a significant positive impact of difflog on presvote. However, the model's goodness of fit is relatively low, with an R-squared \( R^2 \) of 0.08795, suggesting that difflog only explains about 8.8% of the variation in `presvote`.

\section*{Question 5}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger? 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is the incumbent's \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variables are \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote}.

		\end{verbatim} 
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=160, lastline=160]{my_answer_YuFan.R}  
		The model equation is:
		\[
		\text{voteshare} = 0.4486 + 0.0355 \times \text{difflog} + 0.2569 \times \text{presvote}
		\]
		The intercept is 0.4486, indicating that when both difflog and presvote are 0, the predicted voteshare is 0.4486. The coefficient for difflog is 0.0355, meaning that for every 1-unit increase in difflog, voteshare increases by 0.0355 on average, with this result being highly significant (p-value less than 0.001). The coefficient for presvote is 0.2569, suggesting that voteshare increases by 0.2569 for every 1-unit increase in presvote, also highly significant (p-value less than 0.001).
		
		The p-values for all variables (difflog and presvote) are much smaller than 0.001, indicating significant effects on voteshare. The model's goodness of fit, represented by the R-squared \( R^2 \), is 0.4496, suggesting that difflog and presvote together explain about 44.96% of the variation in `voteshare`.
		
		In conclusion, the incumbent’s vote share (voteshare) is significantly influenced by presidential popularity (presvote) and the spending difference compared to the challenger (difflog). The model indicates that these two factors explain 44.96% of the variation in the incumbent's vote share, with both effects being statistically highly significant.
		
		
		\item Write the prediction equation.	
	
			voteshare=0.4486+0.0355×difflog+0.2569×presvote\\
			
			Intercept: 0.4486, representing the predicted voteshare when both difflog and presvote are 0.\\
			difflog coefficient: 0.0355, indicating that for every unit of difflog, voteshare increases by 0.0355 on average.\\
			presvote coefficient: 0.2569, means that for every unit of presvote, voteshare increases by 0.2569.\\

		
		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
		
			I noticed that some parts were actually pretty similar to what I saw in Question 4. Specifically, the relationship between difflog and voteshare stayed significant, just like before. Also, the p-values for the variables are still showing high significance.\\
			
			So, why is this happening? Well, I think it’s because Question 5’s regression model uses both difflog and presvote together, which gives a more complete explanation of the variation in voteshare. In Question 4, I was looking at how the residuals from voteshare and presvote were related, and here in Question 5, I’m seeing a similar trend. It seems like both factors (difflog and presvote) are strongly connected and influence the incumbent’s vote share together.\\
